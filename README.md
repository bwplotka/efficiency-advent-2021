# efficiency-advent-2021

Repo for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in Go with efficient solutions. Note that I focus on "maintainable" efficiency. Imagine those algorithms are needed in critical path, but normal humans have to still be able to maintain it! (: 

You will read more about tricks used here in [Efficient Go Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/efficient-go/9781098105709/), but I left comments on various solutions through the challenges, enjoy! (: 

Inspired by [Advent of Go Profiling 2021](https://felixge.de/2021/12/01/advent-of-go-profiling-2021-day-1-1/.)
